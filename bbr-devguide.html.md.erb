## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

This guide describes the framework for release authors to add backup and restore functionality to their release by using BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR).

BBR is a framework for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments and BOSH Directors. BBR triggers the backup or restore process on the deployment or BOSH Director and transfers the backup artifacts to and from the deployment or BOSH Director.


The BBR framework consists of a command line interface (CLI) and a set of hooks, which call out to scripts. The framework uses BOSH to orchestrate the execution of backup and restore scripts. BBR allows release authors fine-grained control over how their release is backed up.

### <a id="mechanism"></a> Backup Mechanism

Different systems require different strategies for backup and restore. To help release authors make consistent backups of their systems, the BBR framework provides hooks to lock scripts that bring a job to a consistent state before backup begins.

The following diagram illustrates an example BBR script execution sequence.

![In stage 1, the pre-backup-lock script runs in jobs 1 and 2 of instance 0 in group foo, in job 1
of instance 0 in group bar, and in job 1 of instance 1 in group bar. Stage 2 is identical to stage 1,
except that the backup script runs instead of the pre-backup-lock script. Stage 3 is identical to
stage 2, except that the post-backup-unlock script runs instead of the backup script.](images/script-execution-order.png)

Because the framework is focused on the interface, hooks, backup destination, and intra-deployment orchestration, it is mechanism-agnostic.
Release authors can back up their release however they want to, as long as the scripts they write have the correct name and directory structure.

To ensure that backup and restore scripts do not get out of sync with the releases themselves, release authors are responsible for naming, creating, testing, and troubleshooting their own backup and restore scripts.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For all releases, these backup and restore jobs might be co-located with those of other releases. Therefore, release authors must give these jobs unique and descriptive names to avoid name collisions.
</p>

###  <a id='script-implementation'></a>Script Organization

BBR sets out a contract with release authors to call designated backup and restore
scripts under the `/var/vcap/jobs/JOB-NAME/bin/bbr/SCRIPT-NAME` directory:

* Backup script names
  * `pre-backup-lock`
  * `backup`
  * `post-backup-unlock`
* Restore script names
  * `pre-restore-lock`
  * `restore`
  * `post-restore-unlock`
* Metadata script name (if needed)
  * `metadata`

For example, the directory structure of a templated BBR job looks like the below:

* `/var/vcap/jobs/bbr-uaadb/bin/bbr/backup`
* `/var/vcap/jobs/bbr-uaadb/bin/bbr/post-restore-unlock`

Release authors must implement scripts as part of the BBR contract.
Package and distribute the scripts as part of your BOSH release.
The [Exemplar Backup and Restore Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/exemplar-backup-and-restore-release) in GitHub provides examples
of how release authors can structure their jobs to implement the contract with BBR.

The BBR CLI can remotely locate and run the scripts, even if they are located on different VMs.
For example, the lock/unlock scripts can be located on release VMs
while, due to disk-space constraints, the backup/restore scripts are co-located on a separate backup-restore VM.

Scripts are executed in a specific order.
For the backup workflow, the order is `pre-backup-lock`, `backup`, and then `post-backup-unlock`.
For the restore workflow, the order is `pre-restore-lock`, `restore`, and then `post-restore-unlock`.

All scripts should be executable scripts.
ERB tags can be used for templating.

These scripts are executed similarly to other release job scripts, such as `start`, `stop`, or `drain`, and you can use the job's package dependencies.

BBR checks exit codes of the scripts when orchestrating.
Exit code `0` indicates success, and any other exit code indicates a failure.

### <a id='script-ordering'></a>Script Ordering across Jobs

During the backup workflow, all `pre-backup-lock` scripts are invoked before the `backup` scripts on all of the jobs in the deployment.
All `backup` scripts are invoked before the `post-backup-unlock` scripts on all of the jobs in the deployment.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Important</strong>: Both the <code>pre-backup-lock</code> and <code>post-backup-unlock</code> are called in parallel while respecting the locking order constraints.
</p>

During the restore workflow, all `pre-restore-lock` scripts are invoked before the `restore` scripts on all of the jobs in the deployment.
All `restore` scripts are invoked before the `post-restore-unlock` scripts on all of the jobs in the deployment.

By default `pre-backup-lock` and `pre-restore-lock` scripts from different jobs are invoked in an arbitrary order.
You can specify an order for lock scripts from specific jobs in the metadata script.

The `post-backup-unlock` and `post-restore-unlock` scripts from different jobs are invoked in an arbitrary order
when no locking dependency is specified, or the opposite order of lock scripts as stated in metadata scripts.
When a job specifies locking dependency to a job that does not exist in the current deployment, BBR ignores that dependency.

For more information, see [Metadata Script](#metadata) below.

### <a id='logs'></a> Logs

The `stdout` and `stderr` streams are captured and sent to the operator who invokes the backup and restore.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Release authors should avoid printing sensitive information to <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code>.
  BBR prints any output from the scripts in case of failure. Ensure your script does not print any sensitive data, such as credentials.
  In particular, if you are using <code>set -x</code> in your script, add <code>set +x</code> before you use any credentials.
</p>

## <a id='backup-workflow'></a>Backup Workflow

### <a id='pre-backup-lock'></a>Pre-Backup-Lock

The release job can have a `pre-backup-lock` script that stops any processes that could make changes to the components being backed up.
This script must allow the job to lock so that backups are consistent across a cluster.

For example, in a Cloud Foundry deployment, the `pre-backup-lock` script stops Cloud Controller processes
that might make changes to its blobstore and database. This ensures the blobstore and the Cloud Controller database are consistent with each other.

#### Job Configuration

To add a `pre-backup-lock` script to a job:

<ol>
<li>
Create a script with any name in the templates directory of your job.
</li>
<li>
In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/pre-backup-lock</code> as a key-value pair. For example:
<pre class="terminal">
---
name: lock-unlock-acme
templates:
  pre-backup-lock.sh.erb: bin/bbr/pre-backup-lock
</pre>

</li>
<li>
If you want your <code>bin/bbr/pre-backup-lock</code> scripts to run in a specific order, define that order using the optional metadata script. In the sample directory structure illustrated above, this script is called <code>metadata.sh.erb</code>.<br><br>

    a. The metadata script specifies that the current job must be locked before some other job(s) in the deployment.
       When run, this script must print a YAML file to stdout. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "---
backup_should_be_locked_before:
- job_name: lock-unlock-acme
  release: acme-release" </pre>

    b. Add an entry to the templates section of the release job spec file:
<pre class="terminal">
templates:
  ...
  metadata.sh.erb: bin/bbr/metadata
</li>

</pre>
See <a href="#metadata">Metadata Script</a> below for information about the properties you can use in this script.

</ol>


### <a id='backup'></a>Backup

The release job can have a backup script that dumps the backup of the job's database to the directory specified by `$BBR_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY`. For example, when backing up MySQL, this script can invoke the `mysqldump` binary for the MySQL adapter.

There must be at least one job in the deployment providing a backup script. If there is no backup script, calling `backup` or `pre-backup-check` for the deployment fails.

#### Job Configuration

To add a `backup` script to a release job:

1. Create a script with any name in the templates directory of a release job.
2. In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/backup</code> as a key-value pair. For example:

    ```
    ---
    name: backup-restore-acme
    templates:
      backup.erb: bin/bbr/backup
    ```

### <a id='post-backup-unlock'></a>Post-Backup-Unlock

The backup and restore job can have a `post-backup-unlock` script that undoes the operations performed by `pre-backup-lock`.

#### Job Configuration

To add a `post-backup-unlock` script to a release job:

1. Create a script with any name in the templates directory of a release job.
2. In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/post-backup-unlock</code> as a key-value pair. For example:

    ```
    ---
    name: lock-unlock-acme
    templates:
      post-backup-unlock.erb: bin/bbr/post-backup-unlock
    ```

### <a id='error-handling'></a>Error Handling During Backup

If errors occur during the backup workflow, cleanup tasks are executed to put the system back in a working state.

A normal workflow for backing up a deployment does the below:


<% mermaid_diagram do %>
 graph TB
    start(Start) --> check-deployment(Check that the deployment exists)
    check-deployment -- Yes --> make-local-artifact(Make a local artifact dir)
    check-deployment -- No --> exit(Exit)
    make-local-artifact -- Success --> pre-backup(Run pre-backup lock scripts)
    make-local-artifact -- Failure --> exit
    pre-backup -- Success --> backup(Run backup scripts)
    pre-backup -- Failure --> post-backup(Run post-backup-unlock scripts)
    backup --> post-backup
    post-backup -- backup was successful --> drain(Drains artifact from instance)
    post-backup -- backup failed --> cleanup(Removes backup from the instance)
    drain --> cleanup
    cleanup --> exit
<% end %>

## <a id='restore-workflow'></a>Restore Workflow

### <a id='pre-restore-lock'></a>Pre-Restore-Lock

The release job can have a `pre-restore-lock` script that stops any processes that could make changes to the components being restored. This script must allow the job to lock so that restorations are consistent across a cluster.

#### Job Configuration

To add a `pre-restore-lock` script to a job:

1. Create a script with any name in the templates directory of your job.

1. In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/pre-restore-lock</code> as a key-value pair. For example:

    ```
    ---
    name: lock-unlock-acme
    templates:
      pre-restore-lock.sh.erb: bin/bbr/pre-restore-lock
    ```

1. If you want your <code>bin/bbr/pre-restore-lock</code> scripts to run in a specific order, define that order using the optional metadata script. In the sample directory structure illustrated above, this script is called <code>metadata.sh.erb</code>.<br><br>
  The `pre-restore-lock` scripts are called before any `restore` scripts have been called. Success indicates the job is ready to be restored.<br><br>

    a. The metadata script specifies that the current job must be locked before some other job(s) in the deployment. When run, this script must print a YAML file to stdout. For example:

      <pre class="terminal">
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      echo "---
      restore\_should\_be\_locked\_before:
        job_name: lock-unlock-acme
        release: acme-release"
      </pre>

    b. Add an entry to the templates section of the release job spec file:

    ```
    templates:
      ...
      metadata.sh.erb: bin/bbr/metadata
    ```
    See <a href="#metadata">Metadata Script</a> below for information about the properties you can use in this script.

### <a id='restore'></a>Restore

If a release has a `backup` script, it should also have a `restore` script. The `restore` script expects a backup artifact to be provided in `$BBR_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY`. For example, when restoring MySQL, the script invokes `mysql` to restore from a mysqldump file.

#### Job Configuration

To add a `restore` script to a release job:

1. Create a script with any name in the templates directory of a release job.
2. In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/restore</code> as a key-value pair. For example:


    ```yaml
    ---
    name: backup-restore-acme
    templates:
      restore.erb: bin/bbr/restore
    ```


### <a id='post-restore-unlock'></a>Post-Restore-Unlock

The release job can have a `post-restore-unlock` script that resumes normal service operation. `post-restore-unlock` should be idempotent because it can be called multiple times even if `pre-restore-lock` has not been not called.

#### Job Configuration

To add a `post-restore-unlock` script to a release:

1. Create a script with any name in the templates directory of your job.
2. In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/post-restore-unlock</code> as a key-value pair. For example:

    ```
    ---
    name: lock-unlock-acme
    templates:
      post-restore-unlock.sh.erb: bin/bbr/post-restore-unlock
    ```

### <a id='error-handling-restore'></a>Error Handling During Restore

If errors occur during the restore workflow, cleanup tasks are executed to put the system back in a working state.

A normal workflow for restoring a deployment does the below:


<% mermaid_diagram do %>
 graph TB
    start(Start) --> validate-artifact(Check that the artifact is present and the checksums match)
    validate-artifact --> check-deployment-exists(Check that the deployment exists)
    check-deployment-exists -- Yes --> check-deployment-matches-backup(Check the structure of the backup matches the destination deployment)
    check-deployment-exists -- No --> exit(Exit)
    check-deployment-matches-backup -- Yes --> copy-to-remote(Copy the backup artifacts to the relevant VMs)
    check-deployment-matches-backup -- No --> cleanup(Cleanup, close ssh connections)
    copy-to-remote -- Success --> pre-restore-lock(Run pre-restore-lock scripts)
    copy-to-remote -- Failure --> cleanup
    pre-restore-lock -- Success --> restore(Run restore scripts)
    pre-restore-lock -- Failure --> post-restore-unlock(Run post-restore-unlock scripts)
    restore --> post-restore-unlock
    post-restore-unlock --> cleanup
    cleanup --> exit
<% end %>

## <a id='metadata'></a>(Optional) Metadata Script

The `metadata` script is an optional script that `bbr` executes before
any other scripts to get more information about the jobs, for example,
locking dependencies and whether the BBR job is enabled or not.
The script is expected to print a `yaml` on standard out with more information
about the job for backup and restore.

### Job Configuration

To add a `metadata` script to a release job:

1. Create a script with any name in the templates directory of a release job.
2. In the templates section of the release job spec file, add the script name and <code>bin/bbr/metadata</code> as a key-value pair. For example:

    ```yaml
    ---
    name: backup-restore-acme
    templates:
      metadata.erb: bin/bbr/metadata
    ```

### (Optional) Properties

#### backup\_should\_be\_locked\_before

Use this property to specify the locking dependencies for the current job during backup.
The jobs are specified as an array with their release names.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "---
backup_should_be_locked_before:
- job_name: lock-unlock-acme
  release: acme-release" </pre>

#### restore\_should\_be\_locked\_before

If you want your <code>bin/bbr/pre-restore-lock</code> scripts to run in a
specific order, define that order using the metadata script, as above, but with
the `restore_should_be_locked_before` key.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "---
restore_should_be_locked_before:
- job_name: lock-unlock-acme
  release: acme-release" </pre>

#### skip\_bbr\_scripts

Use this property to disable a BBR job.
When the metadata script is templated with this property set to true, the BBR CLI
does not run the BBR scripts in this job.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "---
skip_bbr_scripts: true" </pre>

## <a id='testing'></a>Testing
The functional testing pattern recommended for BBR scripts is:

<ol>
<li>
Create data for which the release is responsible.
</li>
<li>
Back up the release.
</li>
<li>
Delete data.
</li>
<li>
Restore the release.
</li>
<li>
Validate that restored data are correct.
</li>
</ol>

Where scripts are implemented for releases that are part of larger deployments, you should perform end-to-end testing that validates consistency across releases.

## <a id="bbr-utilities"></a>Backup and Restore Utilities

If your release stores state in a Postgres or MySQL database, deploy the `database-backup-restorer` job from the [backup-and-restore-sdk-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/backup-and-restore-sdk-release) GitHub repository.

Ensure your job templates a `config.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "username": "db user",
  "password": "db password",
  "host": "db host",
  "port": "db port",
  "adapter": "bbr supported adapter (e.g. mysql or postgres)",
  "database": "database name"
}
```

Ensure your `backup` and `restore` scripts call the appropriate `database-backup-restorer` binaries as follows:

**Backup**

```bash
/var/vcap/jobs/database-backup-restorer/bin/backup /path/to/config.json

cp <output_file> $ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY
```

**Restore**

```bash
cp $ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY <output_file>

/var/vcap/jobs/database-backup-restorer/bin/restore /path/to/config.json
```

## <a id="bbr-cf"></a>BBR and Cloud Foundry Databases

<p class="note"><strong>Important</strong>: Release authors must ensure the following.
    <br><strong>For CF Releases</strong>---Your scripts must respect the <code>release_level_backup</code> job property so the scripts run if set to <code>true</code>, but do nothing if set to <code>false</code>.
</p>


BBR provides a pattern for Cloud Foundry release authors that ensures their scripts abide by the BBR Framework contract.

A Cloud Foundry operator adds a `backup-restore` instance to their Cloud Foundry deployment. By default, release-specific database `backup` and `restore` job scripts are co-located on this instance along with the `database-backup-restorer` job from the [backup-and-restore-sdk-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/backup-and-restore-sdk-release) GitHub repository.

If your release requires that you stop your component's processes during backup and restore, you also need to provide `unlock` and `lock` scripts. You can co-locate these scripts on either the `backup-restore` instance or your component's instance. You should co-locate these scripts on the component's instance if you want to interact directly with `monit` or your running job.
More information about [`unlock`](#post-backup-unlock) and [`lock`](#pre-backup-lock) scripts are below.

### Naming Recommendations

When Cloud Foundry is deployed, multiple backup and restore scripts are co-located on the
`backup-restore` instance, separated by job name.
For this reason, the job names for each release should have a consistent format
so that there is no confusion between BBR jobs.

The recommendations for job names are as follows:

* Use the prefix `bbr-` to show that the job is bbr-related
* Include the name of the component that is being backed up

For example, you have a release named `acme-release` that has a
database (db) that must be backed up.
The recommended BBR job name for this database is `bbr-acmedb`.
This follows the format `bbr-RELEASE-NAMEdb`.

### <a id="bbr-cf-example"></a>Example

Acme Release is a Cloud Foundry component that has no persistent disk on its component VM.
The release is an API that stores its data in a MySQL database deployed on a different
instance group in this CF deployment.

The release authors have chosen to create two new jobs to be incorporated into
their existing release; one job includes the `backup` and `restore` scripts in
its templates directory, and the other job includes the `pre-backup-lock` and
`post-backup-unlock` scripts.
This is because the operator co-locates the former job on the `backup-restore`
VM and the latter job on the Acme Release VM.

Here is how the backup and restore job should be placed:

<% mermaid_diagram do %>
 graph LR
         subgraph Backup Restore VM
         database-backup-restorer
         bbr-acmedb
         end
         subgraph Acme VM
         acme
         bbr-lock-unlock-acme
         end
         subgraph Acme Release
         jobs/acme-job-->acme
         jobs/bbr-lock-unlock-acme-->bbr-lock-unlock-acme
         jobs/bbr-acmedb-->bbr-acmedb
         end
         subgraph BBR SDK Release
         jobs/database-backup-restorer-->database-backup-restorer
         end

<% end %>

## <a id='drats'></a>Acceptance Tests

The Disaster Recovery Acceptance Test Suite (DRATs) runs against a Cloud
Foundry deployment to ensure that backup and restore works as expected.

For more information and instructions for how to run DRATs, see
[disaster-recovery-acceptance-tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/disaster-recovery-acceptance-tests)
in GitHub.
