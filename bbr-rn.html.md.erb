### <a id='1-8-0'></a> v1.8.0

**Release Date**: September 22, 2020

This version introduces the BBR S3 configuration validator.

For installation and usage instructions, see the [BBR S3 bucket configuration validator README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore/blob/master/s3-config-validator/README.md#bbr-s3-bucket-configuration-validator)
on GitHub.

### <a id='1-7-2'></a> v1.7.2

**Release Date**: March 4, 2020

#### Security Fix

* Updated dependancies to include a security fix.

### <a id='1-7-0'></a> v1.7.0

**Release Date**: February 3, 2020

#### Features

* Added an output log message for the remaining byte percentage of restore files when restoring your deployment.

### <a id='1-6-0'></a> v1.6.0

**Release Date**: January 27, 2020

#### Features

* Added an output log entry for the remaining byte percentage of backup files
 when backing up your deployment.

#### Improvements

* Updated golang to 1.13

### <a id='1-5-2'></a> v1.5.2

**Release Date**: August 29, 2019

#### Features

* Added short version of the `--artifact-path` flag: `-a`

#### Improvements

* BBR does not log the backup as successful if draining fails
* Updated golang crypto and golang sys libraries

### <a id='1-5-1'></a> v1.5.1

**Release Date**: May 3, 2019

#### Features

Added the ability to gracefully skip BOSH jobs. To use this feature, add the following property to the `YOUR-JOB-DIRECTORY/bbr/bin/metadata` file:

```yaml
skip_bbr_scripts: true
```

#### Improvements

Improved error messages when BBR fails while processing a `metadata` file.
Previously, error messages were unnecessarily repeated.

#### Resolved Issues

If the SSH key passed through `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` is invalid, `bbr` does not hang.

### <a id='1-5-0'></a> v1.5.0

**Release Date**: March 27, 2019

#### Features

* Release authors can now specify job dependencies for BOSH Director jobs using the `metadata` hook. For example:

	  ```
	  #!/usr/bin/env bash

	  echo "---
	  restore_should_be_locked_before:
	  - job_name: uaa
	    release: uaa"
	  ```

* Release authors can now tell BBR to backup from one instance of a job (bootstrap node) and restore to all instances by using the BOSH property `bbr.backup_one_restore_all`.

### Deprecation

* **Backwards incompatible:** Dropped support for `backup_name` and `restore_name` properties in the `metadata` hook.
  - **Action required:** if you use these properties, see if you can use the `bbr.backup_one_restore_all` BOSH property to replace this functionality (see https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cfcr-etcd-release/pull/11 as an example).

### <a id='1.4'></a> v1.4.0

**Release Date**: February 21, 2019

#### Features

* Release authors can now check the BBR version by testing the `$BBR_VERSION` variable in `metadata`. For example:

	  ```
	  #!/usr/bin/env bash
	  if [ -z "$BBR_VERSION" ]; then
	    # This message will be printed if using BBR v1.3.x or earlier
	    >&2 echo "BBR_VERSION is not set, unsupported bbr cli, I am out of here"
	    exit 1
	  fi

	  # This message prints if using BBR v1.4 or later.
	  echo "I am ok"
	  ```

* Job dependencies are now supported for `bbr director backup` and `bbr director restore`. Earlier versions of BBR fail when a BOSH Director job declares a dependency.

#### Improvements

* A reminder to run `bbr backup-cleanup` prints if the pre-backup check fails.
	<br><br>
	This can happen if you try to run `bbr backup`, it fails, and then you try to run the command again without cleaning up.
	<br><br>
	Before this change, the reminder to run `bbr backup-cleanup` only printed once, after the first failed backup.

* The size of backup artifacts that are transferred to the BOSH deployment now print during restore. Prior to this change, the artifact size was only printed during backup.

### <a id='1.3'></a> v1.3.2

**Release Date**: January 2, 2019

#### Improvements

* Log files created when using BBR to do a multi-deployment backup can now be read while BBR is running. To do so:
	1. To run BBR in the background, run:

		```
		bbr deployment --all-deployments backup &
		```
	1. To monitor BBR's progress by reading the log files while BBR is running, run:

		```
		tail *.log
		```

### <a id='1.3'></a> v1.3.1

**Release Date**: November 30, 2018

#### Features

* BBR multi-deployment backup log file names now contain timestamps.
  - BBR generates one log file per deployment.
  - Users can retain logs even after running BBR multiple times.
  - BBR writes the log files in the directory passed in the `--backup-artifact` flag.

#### Improvements

* Updated golang dependency to the latest patch

### <a id='1.3'></a> v1.3.0

**Release Date**: November 13, 2018

#### Features

* Introduces parallel multi-deployment backup capabilities.
* `bbr` applies the relevant action to all the BOSH deployments that can be accessed using the provided BOSH credentials.
* The following actions are supported:

	```
	bbr deployment --all-deployments pre-backup-check
	bbr deployment --all-deployments backup
	bbr deployment --all-deployments backup-cleanup
	```

#### Improvements

* Improves support for tunneling using `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` for the interaction between `bbr` and a BOSH Director. For more information, see [Tunneling](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-tunnel/) in the BOSH documentation.
* Adds tunneling support for the `bbr director` commands.

### <a id='1.2'></a> v1.2.8

**Release Date**: September 25, 2018

#### Improvements

* `bbr backup` with `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` was still occasionally failing with `connection reset by peer` errors. This release changes how BBR handles SSH connections, which should make `bbr backup` more stable when used with a SOCKS5 proxy. See the [Pivotal Tracker Story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1662777/stories/160167687) and [Issue #21](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore/issues/21) in GitHub.

* BBR commands now print the job name in the drain logs.
	<br><br>
	The old version of the drain logs appeared in the following format:

	```
	[bbr] XXXX INFO - Copying backup -- 2.6M uncompressed -- from backup-prepare/XXXX...
	```

	The new version of the drain logs appear in the following format:

	```
	[bbr] XXXX INFO - Copying backup -- 2.6M uncompressed -- for job bbr-usage-servicedb on backup-prepare/XXXX...
	```
	<br>
	This should help users understand where backup artifacts are coming from. See the [Pivotal Tracker Story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1662777/stories/159265175).

#### Resolved Issues

* Backup metadata were wrongly reporting the job index for backup artifacts.
	<br>
	Consider the example of a multi-master CFCR cluster. The backup artifact is always coming from `master/0` while `master/1` and `master/2` provide no backup artifact. However, previously it was not always reported (in the backup metadata) that the artifact was coming from `master/0`.
* This makes no noticeable difference but it fixes the accuracy of the metadata file. See the [Pivotal Tracker Story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1662777/stories/160141669).
